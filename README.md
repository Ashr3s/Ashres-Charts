<h1> Basic Introduction To This Website </h1>
<p> Hello! Here is a collection of some of the music charts I create, typically pertaining to the Billboard Hot 100 chart, including Billboard Hot 100 Projections (released on Saturday/Sunday) and other custom charts. All charts are also available on my Twitter: (https://twitter.com/ashres_charts). I also work on some charts with online friends, we work on a group account to publish these charts. These group charts can be viewed at: (https://twitter.com/chartessentials). Note that none of the metrics displayed are official, all values are estimated.
<h1> Basic Introduction To Music Charts </p>
<p> Music charts, including the Billboard Hot 100, and other charts that attempt to determine the most popular songs in the United States, collect data from many different resources and forms of consumption. They can typically be broken down into three components: </p>
<p> Airplay (The number of people who listen to a song on the Radio) </p>
<p> Sales (The number of purchases a song recieved on platforms such as iTunes, Amazon, D2C, or physically through CDs and Vinyl) </p>
<p> Streaming (The number of people who stream a song using a streaming service such as Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, YouTube, etc.) </p>
<p> All these metrics are combined in a formula to generate "points" for a song on the chart. The more points a song has, the higher it will place. Old songs are removed from the chart through "recurrency" which occurs when a song falls below #50 on the chart with over 20 weeks or #25 with over 52 weeks (note: songs gaining in performance are able to bypass this rule). </p>
<h1> Chart Legend </h2>
<p> 
Pos: Position of a song </p>
<p> +/-: Change in position of a song (RE means re-entry and NEW means a new charting song) </p>
<p> Peak: The highest position a song has been on the chart </p>
<p> WoC: Weeks on Chart (number of weeks a song has been charting) </p>
<p> Diff: Percent change in points from last week to this week </p>
